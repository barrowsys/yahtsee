# Yet Another Html Templating System: Embracing Elements

no trademark infringement intended lol

this is nowhere near ready, this is just a proof of concept to show it can be done. i'm just so entirely done fighting with this compiler i have to prove it's at least *possible*,

# Usage

reads from stdin, writes to stdout. so do something like
```
cat template.html | cargo run > index.html
```
